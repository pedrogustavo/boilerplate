# Boilerplate
Boilerplate front-end for development using HTML, SASS and Gulp

This boilerplate was inspired by [FastShell](https://hosseinkarami.com/fastshell/).

This boilerplate was created with the aim of speeding up the development of HTML projects. Just clone the repository and install its dependencies using `npm i`.
